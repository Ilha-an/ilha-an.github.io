# Welcome to HerVoice
Empowering Women, Amplifying Voices, Mobilizing Change

About Us
Her Voice is an AI-powered initiative designed to tackle the global crisis of gender-based violence. We believe in the power of technology to raise awareness, support survivors, and drive systemic change. Our mission is simple: to give a voice to those who have been silenced, using cutting-edge AI tools to provide resources, safety, and advocacy for women across the globe.

Our Mission
We are committed to leveraging AI to combat gender-based violence by:

Empowering survivors: Offering AI-driven resources for reporting, counseling, and finding safety.
Raising awareness: Educating the public and policymakers about the prevalence and impact of violence against women.
Mobilizing communities: Creating tools to help communities unite and take action, from local advocacy to global initiatives.
The Solution
Her Voice uses Microsoft Fabric and Azure AI to create a platform where survivors can securely access resources, report incidents anonymously, and connect with a network of supporters. Our platform is designed to:

Anonymize reporting: Ensuring that survivors can report incidents without fear of retaliation or exposure.
Provide critical resources: AI-driven recommendations for shelter, legal assistance, counseling, and support groups.
Foster community: A space for advocates, survivors, and allies to share stories, support one another, and drive policy change.
